    <p>Next came a massage that I was not expecting. It started with a bit
    of manipulation of the temples, followed by the barber's attempt to drag the
    top half of my face down towards my chin (and vice-versa) with his big burly
    hands. I'm sure it's good for you. I wasn't sure it was good for me, though.
    He then made his way down to my shoulders and managed to pull me around in
    such a way that I squealed like a girl. This was not relaxing -- this was
    painful! Evidently I was knotted up. I must have needed it, I reasoned.</p>
    <p>There was an audible crack as he grabbed my head and twisted it to the
    right, all of it quite unexpected. To the left, no cracking sound. And we
    weren't quite done yet ...</p> <p>To finish off, the barber got a pair
    of tongs. He took a ball of cotton wool and wrapped it tightly around the
    tip of the tongs, so that it looked like a large cotton bud. He then doused
    the cotton wool in what must have been pure alcohol, set it on fire, and began
    to fling it at my face. Using one hand to cover the top of my ear and my hair,
    he flashed it against my ear, singeing the small hairs in and around the ear.</p>
