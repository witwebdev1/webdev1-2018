			<h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
			<p>For centuries,
                                Japanese Zen masters have cultivated gardens of
                                harmoniously arranged rocks and white raked gravel
                                - creating silent havens for peaceful contemplation.</p>
                         <p>By cultivating a miniature Zen garden - reducing for
                              a moment the day&#146;s problems to a few waves
                              of sand against the rocks - one may come away feeling
                              as if the rest of life has become simpler.</p>
                         <p>The garden, after all, has no plants&#151;no flowers, no trees, not even any weeds.</p>

			<h3>Japanese miniature rock gardens</h3>
			<p>Muso
                        Soseki, a Zen priest and poet known as the father of the
                        Zen rock garden, was born on the west coast of Japan in
                        1275, and died in 1351 in a temple on the outskirts of
                        Kyoto, where he had created one of his last rock
                        gardens.</p>
                        <p>This
                        inner contemplation and calm can lead to a fresh outlook
                        and clear mind. Like a restorative balm, Zen gardening
                        is an antidote to stresses of modern living.</p>
                        <p>
                        A
                        Zen garden can create a feeling of space in your garden,
                        home or office - or impart a sense of order and a spirit
                        of tranquility and calm.</p>
                        <p>
                        The gardens are a means
                        to discover the sources and strengths of our natural humanity
                        which, according to Zen teaching, is poised, calm, sincere
                        and capable of facing all matters in life with calmness
                        and perfect composure.</p>


			<h3>Zen
                        rock gardens both disarm and empower us.</h3>
			<p>They
                        are so radically different from all other gardens we know
                        that our usual responses must give way to deeper ones.</p>
                        <p>
                        This
                        little Zen garden encourages you to create or just play.
                        It reflects your inner feelings through the designs and
                        patterns you rake. That
                        is when small things take on a bigger resonance, when
                        we have the chance to glimpse the meaning of the world
                        in a grain of sand, for it has been framed in majestic
                        simplicity. It
                        will bring stillness to your nerves, let your mind float,
                        sweeten your soul, or like a book reach down into some
                        deeper earthiness of your more secret nature.</p>
                        <p>
                        Behind
                        this miniature garden lies centuries of disciplined striving
                        and spiritual development. For the Japanese it is an instrument
                        of meditation and relaxation - in the West it is regarded
                        as a stress reliever.</p>
