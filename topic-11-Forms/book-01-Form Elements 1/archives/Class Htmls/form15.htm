<h1>Form Textarea Example Two</h1>
<form>
<textarea id="comments" name="comments" rows = "5" cols="40" >
This is a text area with 5 rows and 40
columns visible by default. The text
inside the element is its default value.
Although the control is limited in size,
the text entered can be larger than this
size, and the user agent will presumably
offer a scrolling mechanism for it.
