 <h2>About WIT </h2>
 <p>Waterford Institute of Technology is one of the largest institutes of technology in Ireland. It was established as a Regional Technical College in 1970, and was the first to be awarded Institute of Technology status in 1998. Over the period of this process, and as a result of an international quality review, the Institute was granted delegated authority by the National Council for Educational Awards to confer its own Certificates and Diplomas.
 </p><p>
The Institute now confers its own awards at all levels from Higher Certificate to PhD,
subject to standards set and monitored by the Higher Education and Training Awards Council
(HETAC) which was established by the Government in June 2001,
under the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999.
The quality and standard of Irish educational awards is fully recognised globally.
All Irish awards are included in the national framework of qualifications maintained
by the <a href = "http://www.nqai.ie" target="_blank">National Qualifications Authority of Ireland</a>.
</p><p class="news">
Waterford Institute of Technology has the highest number of students within the Institute of Technology sector, outside of Dublin, participating at ordinary degree level and above. The Institute also offers unique post doctoral programmes in a number of specialist areas.
</p><p>
Being the major provider of higher education in the South East region of Ireland,
the Institutes current full-time equivalent student cohort is in excess of six thousand, while part-time student enrolments exceed 3,000.
The range of academic programmes is exceptionally extensive covering the Humanities,

Welcome to the Institute's website which is designed with a number of different perspectives in mind, most notably the student perspective.
</p><p>
In making programme choices, at whatever level, incoming students are also making career choices. It is important, then, that these decisions are well-informed and enlightened.
</p><p>
Visitors to this website are advised to seek out in detail all aspects of the programmes on offer. Equally important is the life and culture of the Institute. It is anticipated that the site will convey something of this culture, socially and academically.
</p><p>
The Institute is renowned for its academic prowess and renowned, too, for its hospitality for new ideas and for new people. It provides for a campus where participation is encouraged across a wide range of activities.
</p><p>That sense of participation encourages a sense of belonging and a positive experience of the campus as an inclusive learning environment.
